Here I'll show you some *lists* and a **block quote**.And also I need a table ~~which is hard to make~~.
* a bulleted list.
* I don't know what to write.
* So I just do like this.

1. There is the other list
2. I use some numbers as asked.
3. These are all the lists.

And we can also put a block quote into lists,such as:
* First
    > I will write this.  
    > I think this is enough.
* Second
    > Actually, I have no idea about other items.
   
Now it's time for the list.
